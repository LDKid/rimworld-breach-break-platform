# Rimworld Mod: Breach Breaks Platform
With this mod, when an anomaly tries to escape containment, it will damage the platform instead. The amount of damage is based on the entity's minimum containment strength.
When it attempts to escape a notification is also sent.

### Requirements
- [Rimworld Anomaly DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380740)
- [Harmony](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009463077)

### Configuration
- You can toggle whether or not the platform should be destroyed. (If toggled off, the entity will check the platform's health and if it's low enough it'd break it, it'll just escape instead)
- You can change the platform damage multiplier for escape attempts.

### Mod Compatibility
It is fully compatible with [SYSMY's Lobotomy Corporation escape music](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3221377926): Escape music will only trigger when anomalies succesfully escape however, while using the mod, music will always stop playing when an escape attempt is made. Better compatibility may come in the future.

###### I'm sure this isn't optimised so if anyone want's to help out I'll happily improve the code. This mod was made out of curiosity of how easy it'd be to do, but since I like the idea I decided to make it public.
